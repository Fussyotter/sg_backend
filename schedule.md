#  I'm testing django channels tutorials on my test branch.  I'm using a new templates directory just to follow along and see if the chat functionality is working.  I don't know if I'll keep it like this or swap to a react front end and then adjust chat to work with that.  
# 4/5/23
# testing more ways to get authenticated users tied to chat rooms. slightly worried about transfering this to a front end that isn't django
# trying new views and urls to attempt auth users in chat rooms @branch centrifuge
# ok new views/urls work by requiring auth so I guess that's good.  Need to find way to get self.username to display in every message now and then i'll be okay with progress
